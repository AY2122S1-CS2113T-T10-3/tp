# Decodex User Guide <!-- omit in toc -->

## Introduction

Decodex is a **Command Line Interface (CLI) application for Capture-The-Flag (CTF) players to quickly process data from one encoding format to another with extreme ease**. It also allows you to build recipes, sequences of data processing instructions, to speed up repetitive tasks. The intuitive interaction can help speed up a player's performance during CTFs and save time without having to manually code the tedious data transformations.

This guide serves to help you understand the usage of the program to encode and decode data, as well as create recipes to automate multiple encoding or decoding processes in sequence.

> :information_source: This user guide is tailored for CTF players who have basic understanding of information security concepts.

## Features

> :information_source: Arguments enclosed in `<>` are **mandatory** arguments while arguments enclosed in `{}` are **optional** arguments. For example, `select <moduleName> {moduleArgument}` would mean that `moduleName` is mandatory while `moduleArgument` is optional.

> :information_source: Arguments must be entered in the **exact order and position** as specified in the commands' respective formats.

> :information_source: All commands and arguments are **case-sensitive**.

### Understanding the Application's Prompt

![carbon(17).png](images/carbon(17).png)

After running the program, it would display a prompt showing the name of the program `Decodex` , followed by the name of the recipe that is "currently being edited" (if any) in `[]`. This currently edited recipe will be the target for some `recipe` commands such as `recipe push`, `recipe pop` and `recipe reset`.

### Basic Commands

#### Input of Data: `input`

Stores the data to be processed by modules.

Format: `input <data>`

> :information_source: `data` will be treated as text.

Examples:

- `input SGVsbG9Xb3JsZA==` Enter base64-encoded data.
- <code>input â€‚hello world</code> Enter plain text as data.

![carbon(1).png](images/carbon(1).png)

> :exclamation: Note that the program will consider all characters as `data` following the first space character in the input command. Observe the leading and trailing whitespaces in the result of the second command in the above screenshot.

> :exclamation: Non-printable characters (e.g. null characters) may not be correctly displayed and could potentially scramble the user interface.

#### List Available Modules or Recipes: `list`

Shows a list of all available modules.

Format: `list`

![carbon(8).png](images/carbon(8).png)

#### Selecting a Module or Recipe: `select`

Selects a module and processes the data accordingly. Subsequent selection of modules will process the transformed data output from the previous module.

Format: `select <moduleName>`

`moduleName` is the name of an available module supported by the program.

Examples:

- `select base64decode` Decode the base64 encoded data.
- `select hexencode` Encode the data into hexadecimal format.

> :exclamation: Non-printable characters (e.g. null characters) may not be correctly displayed and could potentially scramble the user interface.

#### Resetting Data: `reset`

Resets the transformed data back to the original input.

Format: `reset`

#### Exiting the Program: `exit`

Exit the program.

Format: `exit`

### Recipe Commands: `recipe`

#### Create a New Recipe: `recipe new`

#### Select a Recipe for Editing: `recipe select`

#### List Modules in a Recipe: `recipe list`

#### Add a Module to a Recipe: `recipe push`

#### Remove a Module from a Recipe: `recipe pop`

#### Clear All Modules in a Recipe: `recipe reset`

#### Delete a Recipe: `recipe delete`

### Saving Recipe to File
