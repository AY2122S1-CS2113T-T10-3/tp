# Setting Up, Getting Started

## Setting up the on your computer

1. Forking and cloning
    1. **Fork** our repository.
    2. Then, **clone** the fork onto your computer.

1. Editor
    1. We highly recommend using Intellij IDEA, which can be downloaded from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
    2. However, you may still use other editors that you prefer. Just take note that most of our set ups are centered around Intellij.
2. Configure JDK
    1. Follow the guide at *[[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Configuring the JDK](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijJdk.html)* to ensure Intellij is configured to use **JDK 11**.
3. Importing project
    1. Follow the guide at *[[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Importing a Gradle project](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijImportGradleProject.html)* to import the forked project into Intellij.

> Note: Importing a Gradle project is slightly different from importing a normal Java project.
